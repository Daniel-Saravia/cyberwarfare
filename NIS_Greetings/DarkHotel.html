<h1 class="title">DarkHotel: A South Korean-Based Advanced Persistent Threat Group</h1>
<p class="cont_txt">
DarkHotel is a nation-state sponsored Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) group suspected to originate from South Korea. This group targets company executives and high-ranking political figures staying at luxury hotels across Korea, China, Japan, and Russia. The group’s name originates from its frequent exploitation of hotel Wi-Fi networks (WLANs) to breach devices containing Personally Identifiable Information (PII). DarkHotel has targeted individuals in sectors such as defense, transportation, telecommunications, and other critical industries.
</p>

<h2 class="cont_tit">Tracked Names</h2>
<p class="cont_txt">
DarkHotel is also known by several aliases, including Shadow Crane, DUBNIUM, Fallout Team, Karba, Luder, Nemim, Black Shop, Nemain, Tapaoux, APT-C-06, Pioneer, and TUNGSTEN BRIDGE.

<h2 class="cont_tit">Tracked Individuals</h2>
<p class="cont_txt">
No specific individuals are currently identified as part of the DarkHotel group.
</p>

<h2 class="cont_tit">Known Cyber-Attack Specializations</h2>
<ul class="cont_txt">
<li>Exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities (notably in Windows Kernel and Internet Explorer).</li>
<li>Compromising WLANs to access PII on smartphones and laptops.</li>
<li>Spear Phishing using HUMINT sources, such as political and business news.</li>
<li>Delivering multi-layered malicious documents to activate PowerShell scripts (using Excel, MS Paint).</li>
<li>Drive-by Compromise attacks, manipulating hotel login portals.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="cont_tit">Threat Summary</h2>
<p class="cont_txt">
DarkHotel is a highly skilled APT group with a history of discovering zero-day vulnerabilities. The group poses a serious threat to the Republic of Korea, especially given its track record of targeting business and diplomatic executives in sectors critical to South Korea’s national security. It is essential for South Korea to implement detection and prevention measures to track and counteract DarkHotel operations.
</p>

<h2 class="cont_tit">Attack Process</h2>
<p class="cont_txt">
A notable attack by DarkHotel occurred in 2021, targeting 17 luxury hotels in Macao, China, including the Grand Coloane Resort and Wynn Palace. The group used spear phishing emails aimed at hotel staff with high-level system access. The email included an Excel attachment with malicious macros activated upon opening, creating scheduled tasks to conduct reconnaissance, list data, and exfiltrate information. Communication to a Command-and-Control server was established through PowerShell scripts. The email appeared to be sent from the "Macao Government Tourism Office," and the C2 server spoofed the Government of the Federated States of Micronesia, showcasing DarkHotel's sophisticated social engineering techniques. This attack likely aimed to establish control for future attacks involving high-value targets at these hotels.

<h2 class="cont_tit">Detection and Prevention Strategy</h2>

<h3>Detection and Tracking Recommendations</h3>
<ul class="cont_txt">
<li>Identify future attacks through Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) and Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) associated with DarkHotel.</li>
<li>Continuous monitoring and information gathering on DarkHotel activities.</li>
<li>Collaboration and information sharing across luxury hotel networks (e.g., RH-ISAC).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Prevention and Mitigation Recommendations</h3>
<ul class="cont_txt">
<li>Conduct risk assessments to identify vulnerabilities in hotel networks and infrastructure.</li>
<li>Implement vulnerability management practices, including system scanning and patching.</li>
<li>Promote security awareness on phishing attack techniques among hotel staff and executives.</li>
</ul>
<p class="cont_txt">
Through these strategies, South Korea can better detect and mitigate future attacks from DarkHotel. These measures align with South Korea’s cyberwarfare strategy, which emphasizes collaboration and cooperation to mitigate emerging cyber threats.
