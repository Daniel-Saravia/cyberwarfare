  <!-- Description -->
  <h2 class="cont_tit">Description</h2>
  <p class="cont_txt">
    An offensive challenge in the cyberwarfare strategy of South Korea is the ethical, operational, and technical complexities around the exploitation of critical infrastructure system vulnerabilities within adversarial states. Cyber attacks against energy grids, transport networks, or telecommunications may paralyze an adversary, but with risks of escalation, collateral damage, and even violation of international norms. 
  </p>
  <p class="cont_txt">
    For instance, attacks on the highly centralized infrastructure of North Korea would be extremely crippling but may also lead to a response, possibly against the critical sectors of South Korea. The challenge involves operational secrecy, control of unwanted escalation, and problems of scoping the extension of such actions.

  <h2 class="cont_tit">Plan</h2>
  
  <h3>Before Action</h3>
  <ul class="cont_txt">
    <li>Conduct detailed strategic planning, identifying specific vulnerabilities through intelligence gathering and vulnerability exploitation.</li>
    <li>Lay out clear objectives to minimize collateral damage and avoid unintended civilian impacts.</li>
    <li>Perform legal and ethical reviews in alignment with South Korea's cyberwarfare strategy and international norms, including NATO directives.</li>
    <li>Develop and test custom malware in secure and controlled operational environments.</li>
    <li>Prepare contingency plans with allies for diplomatic and defensive support in case of unintended implications.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>During Action</h3>
  <ul class="cont_txt">
    <li>Carefully monitor and control the operation to maintain focus and reduce risks.</li>
    <li>Stage deployment to enable real-time analytics and modification of tactics as needed.</li>
    <li>Communicate through secure, isolated channels to prevent leaks or adversarial interception.</li>
    <li>Continuously assess the operation’s impact to ensure adherence to the intended scope and prevent escalation.</li>
    <li>Implement immediate containment measures if unintended consequences arise to keep the operation within ethical and strategic boundaries.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>After Action</h3>
  <ul class="cont_txt">
    <li>Conduct a thorough post-event analysis to evaluate success and collateral damage.</li>
    <li>Perform forensic analysis to trace how the adversary’s system was breached and document lessons learned.</li>
    <li>Summarize findings in a detailed report for South Korean leadership and allies, outlining attack vectors, objectives achieved, and areas for improvement.</li>
    <li>Implement mitigation strategies to defend South Korea’s critical infrastructure from potential retaliation.</li>
    <li>Engage in diplomatic efforts to strengthen regional defenses and maintain transparency.</li>
    <li>Revise policies and protocols based on findings, and conduct continuous testing and simulations to refine future offensive capabilities.</li>
  </ul>
