<h3><span>Kiara Catalano</span></h3>

<h1 class="title">Introduction</h1>
<p class="cont_txt">
UNC4899 is a newly identified threat actor attributed to North Korea’s Reconnaissance General Bureau. This actor successfully hacked into JumpCloud, a U.S.-based IT company whose software serves over 180,000 organizations and more than 5,000 customers globally. As the U.S. is a NATO ally to South Korea, this attack has implications for South Korea’s national cybersecurity strategy. The attack was traced to Pyongyang through a compromised IP address, revealing links to a North Korean subnet (175.45.178.0/24). Pyongyang has historically used cyber operations, including cryptocurrency theft, to fund its nuclear weapons program and gather intelligence.
</p>

<h2 class="cont_tit">Description of Cyber Operation</h2>
<p class="cont_txt">
The UNC4899 operation began with a sophisticated spearphishing campaign on June 22, 2023, granting unauthorized access to five customers and ten systems. Hackers compromised JumpCloud systems, inserting a malicious Ruby script, <code>init.rb</code>, into the command framework, triggering a software supply chain attack. This script was activated on June 27, 2023, specifically targeting four systems running macOS Venture versions 13.3 or 13.4.1.
</p>

<h3>Second-Stage Payload - FULLHOUSE.DOORED</h3>
<p class="cont_txt">
Following the initial activation, a second-stage payload named FULLHOUSE.DOORED deployed additional malware. FULLHOUSE.DOORED, a C/C++ backdoor, supports HTTP-based communication and can execute shell commands, transfer files, manage files, and inject processes.
</p>

<h3>Additional Malware - STRATOFEAR and TIEDYE</h3>
<p class="cont_txt">
After executing FULLHOUSE.DOORED, UNC4899 deployed two additional malware variants: STRATOFEAR and TIEDYE. STRATOFEAR gathers system information and retrieves or executes modules from a remote server or disk, while TIEDYE communicates with a remote server, executing commands, gathering basic system information, and managing shell commands. Prior payloads were removed from the systems to avoid detection and reduce suspicion.

<h2 class="cont_tit">Offensive Cyber Strategy</h2>

<h3>Recommended Tool/Weapon</h3>
<ul class="cont_txt">
<li>Spearphishing emails</li>
<li>Raspberry Pi</li>
<li>Malicious scripts</li>
</ul>

<h3>Purpose of Each Cyber Tool/Weapon</h3>
<ul class="cont_txt">
<li><strong>Spearphishing emails:</strong> Uses social engineering techniques to get unsuspecting users to open a file, link, or submit information, providing attackers unauthorized access or data.</li>
<li><strong>Raspberry Pi:</strong> A small, customizable device that can be preloaded with malware to scan, monitor, or exploit a network, serving as a remote access point.</li>
<li><strong>Malicious scripts:</strong> Injects harmful code into legitimate websites (XSS) or modifies code to introduce malware onto a user’s device.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="cont_tit">Legal Issues Governing the Authorized Conduct of Cyber Operations</h2>

<h3>South Korea – Personal Information Protection Act (PIPA)</h3>
<p class="cont_txt">
PIPA defines principles for protecting personal data, rights of individuals, and the state’s obligations. Key Articles include:
</p>
<ul class="cont_txt">
<li><strong>Article 3:</strong> Defines data protection requirements such as accurate data processing, purpose limitation, and security safeguards.</li>
<li><strong>Article 4:</strong> Grants individuals rights to be informed, consent, access, correct, and delete their data.</li>
<li><strong>Article 5:</strong> Obligates the government to implement policies supporting privacy and self-regulation.</li>
<li><strong>Articles 15-22:</strong> Restricts personal information collection, use, and third-party sharing to cases with user consent or legal necessity.</li>
<li><strong>Articles 29-34:</strong> Outlines data protection measures like privacy risk assessments and breach notifications.</li>
<li><strong>Penalty Provisions:</strong> Violations can result in up to 10 years of imprisonment or a 100 million won fine, depending on severity.</li>
</ul>
<p class="cont_txt">
Based on PIPA, the JumpCloud hack is illegal, involving unauthorized data collection and misuse, potentially leading to severe penalties if prosecuted in South Korea.
</p>

<h3>U.S. – Cyber Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA)</h3>
<p class="cont_txt">
The CFAA prohibits unauthorized computer access and damage. Key sections include:
</p>
<ul class="cont_txt">
<li><strong>Section (a)(1), (a)(2):</strong> Prohibits unauthorized access to protected computers.</li>
<li><strong>Section (a)(5):</strong> Prohibits knowingly sending code or commands that cause damage.</li>
<li><strong>Section (a)(6):</strong> Prohibits trafficking in access information to allow unauthorized access.</li>
<li><strong>Section (a)(7):</strong> Prohibits using threats to extort by promising unauthorized access.</li>
</ul>
<p class="cont_txt">
Penalties range from 1 to 20 years of imprisonment, depending on the severity, with UNC4899’s actions falling under unauthorized access and data collection, punishable up to 10 years if prosecuted in the U.S.
</p>

<h2 class="cont_tit">Summary of Tools, Techniques, Technology, and Data Used</h2>
<ul class="cont_txt">
<li><strong>Social Engineering:</strong> Influences actions using reciprocity, authority, and other principles to deceive users.</li>
<li><strong>Malicious Scripts and Payloads:</strong> Inject harmful code for monitoring, data exfiltration, and system exploitation.</li>
<li><strong>Code Injection:</strong> Alters program execution by embedding malicious code.</li>
<li><strong>Server Supply Chain Attacks:</strong> Targets third-party suppliers to compromise systems.</li>
<li><strong>Evasion Techniques:</strong> Removes payloads to avoid detection and alerting system administrators.</li>
</ul>

<h3><span>Kenneth Riel</span></h3>

<h3>Recommended Tool/Weapon</h3>
<p class="cont_txt">
Defensive tools include Next-Generation Firewalls (NGFW), Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) platforms, and Extended Detection and Response (XDR) systems.
</p>

<h3>Purpose and Summary of Each Cyber Tool/Weapon</h3>
<ul class="cont_txt">
<li><strong>NGFW:</strong> Detects and prevents network intrusions, monitors for suspicious activity, and blocks malicious IPs and domains.</li>
