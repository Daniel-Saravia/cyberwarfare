      <h3>Concern 1: Legality of Cyberwarfare Initiatives</h3>
      <p class="cont_txt">
        A major concern for the Republic of Korea is the legality of its cyberwarfare strategy and initiatives regarding how foreign adversaries and NATO partnered countries will interpret the Republic of Korea’s activities. Precisely, there is a vast grey-area surrounding cyberwarfare activities meaning that a misstep can cause conflict with other countries. The potential consequences could include a breach of partnership, retaliation, and isolation from NATO allied countries. The Republic of Korea may also face monetary losses if its cyberwarfare activities violate ethical and legal standards. To mitigate this risk, the Republic of Korea will continuously pursue meaningful communications with NATO allied countries, drive innovation within the cyber law space, and implement internal controls like self-assessments to prevent cyberwarfare activities from violating an intended scope and being misinterpreted. In summary, through enforcing its cyberwarfare mission and strategy, the Republic of Korea can maintain ethical and legal boundaries while opting for an enhanced offensive and defensive cyberwarfare infrastructure.

      <h3>Concern 2: Interference From Foreign Adversaries</h3>
      <p class="cont_txt">
        Another major concern for the Republic of Korea is the potential impact that foreign adversaries like North Korea may have on our cyber operations. Specifically, this includes state-sponsored APT groups that work with countries interested in attacking the Republic of Korea’s infrastructure. Critical sectors including defense, communications, energy, and transportation may be targeted to hinder the Republic of Korea’s economy and cyberwarfare initiatives. There is also the risk of foreign adversaries conducting espionage to gather private intel on our cyberwarfare strategy and communications with NATO allied countries. To mitigate this risk, the Republic of Korea will continue to improve and extend its cyberwarfare strategy across both defensive and offensive methodologies. Through global cooperation with allies, improving our cybersecurity resilience through defensive initiatives, and continuing to drive innovation in the space of cyber laws and regulations, the Republic of Korea can reduce the impact of attacks and hinder the efforts of foreign adversaries.
