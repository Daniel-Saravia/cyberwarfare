<p class="cont_txt">
  <strong>The National Intelligence Service (NIS)</strong> is South Korea's chief intelligence agency. Established in 1961 as the Korean Central Intelligence Agency (KCIA), it was renamed the Agency for National Security Planning (ANSP) in 1981 before adopting its current name in 1999.<br /><br />

  <strong>Responsibilities:</strong><br />
  - Collecting and coordinating intelligence related to national strategy and security.<br />
  - Maintaining classified information and safeguarding secure facilities.<br />
  - Investigating crimes that threaten national security.<br />
  - Overseeing national cybersecurity policy and defending against cyber threats.<br /><br />

  <strong>Organizational Structure:</strong><br />
  The agency is divided into three main directorates:<br />
  - International Affairs<br />
  - Domestic Affairs<br />
  - North Korean Affairs<br />
  One of its core functions is gathering intelligence on North Korea to support inter-Korean strategies.<br /><br />

  <strong>Leadership and Governance:</strong><br />
  The NIS operates under the direct jurisdiction of the President of South Korea. The leadership includes:<br />
  - A Director, appointed by the President following a confirmation hearing by the National Assembly.<br />
  - A Deputy Director and Executive Director, appointed by the President based on the Director's recommendations.<br /><br />

  <strong>Cybersecurity and Strategic Role:</strong><br />
  The NIS plays a vital role in monitoring national computer networks, analyzing cyber threats, and providing industrial security information to protect critical infrastructure. It also supports South Korea's long-term efforts toward reunification under a liberal democracy.<br /><br />

  The NIS remains a cornerstone of South Koreaâ€™s national security, focusing on intelligence, cybersecurity, and North Korea-related affairs.
