<h1 class="title">Kimsuky - APT43 Disclaimer</h1>
<p class="cont_txt">
Please note that the cyber espionage activities of Kimsuky, also known as APT43, are associated with the North Korean government. This document will discuss the operation from the perspective of South Korea, examining both offensive and defensive considerations in response to this threat.
</p>

<h2 class="cont_tit">Kimsuky - APT43 Overview</h2>
<p class="cont_txt">
Kimsuky, also known as APT43, Thallium, Black Banshee, Velvet Chollima, and Emerald Sleet, is a North Korean threat actor group associated with the North Korean government. Active since at least 2012 and first identified in 2013 by Kaspersky researchers, Kimsuky has been involved in cyber espionage targeting government, research, and defense sectors in countries including South Korea, the United States, and Japan. The group primarily targets government agencies, think tanks, media, and nuclear sectors, focusing on gathering intelligence. Kimsuky is believed to have connections to other North Korean APT groups such as Lazarus and APT37 (Reaper).
</p>

<h2 class="cont_tit">Offensive Cyber Strategy</h2>

<h3>Phishing Campaigns - Initial Access Tool</h3>
<p class="cont_txt">
Phishing campaigns are essential for initiating access in cyber espionage. Kimsuky has used tailored spear-phishing attacks to exploit vulnerabilities in target organizations, establishing footholds for further data gathering. They create spoofed and fraudulent personas for social engineering use, masquerade as key individuals in their target area, and leverage stolen personally identifiable information (PII) to create accounts and register domains.
</p>

<h3>Malware Implants - Persistence and Data Collection</h3>
<p class="cont_txt">
Kimsuky deploys custom malware such as BabyShark, Gold Dragon, and SWEETDROP, designed to maintain persistence within networks, conduct reconnaissance, and exfiltrate sensitive information to North Korean command centers. BabyShark malware is used to collect data and is often delivered through spear-phishing emails. Gold Dragon is a data-gathering tool that can perform basic reconnaissance, data extraction, and download additional components from its command and control (C2) server, ensuring a lasting presence on victims' systems. SWEETDROP is a malware dropper that collects basic system information.

<h2 class="cont_tit">Notable Attacks</h2>

<h3>UN Security Council Attack (2020)</h3>
<ul class="cont_txt">
  <li><strong>Overview:</strong> Between March and April 2020, the Kimsuky group attempted to compromise the accounts of several UN officials through spear-phishing, aiming to access or spread malware onto the victims' systems.</li>
  <li><strong>Techniques:</strong> The group used spear-phishing emails and messages, posing as UN security alerts or requests from journalists for interviews, to lure officials into accessing phishing pages. These attempts were made via email and communication platforms such as WhatsApp.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Operation Stolen Pencil (December 2018)</h3>
<ul class="cont_txt">
  <li><strong>Overview:</strong> This operation targeted academia and research institutions, primarily in regions with ties to South Korean policy matters.</li>
  <li><strong>Techniques:</strong> Kimsuky used spear-phishing emails to lure victims to websites that appeared to be legitimate academic organizations. Victims were then prompted to install a malicious Google Chrome extension capable of stealing cookies and passwords from the browser, process memory, network sniffing, and keylogging. The specific goals of this attack remain unknown.</li>
</ul>
