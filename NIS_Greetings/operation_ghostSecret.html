<h1 class="title">Operation GhostSecret Disclaimer</h1>
<p class="cont_txt">
Please note that the global espionage operation GhostSecret was conducted by a North Korean-sponsored group in 2018. However, for educational purposes, this section of the South Korea Cyberwarfare website will discuss this operation from the perspective of South Korea with both defensive and offensive considerations.
</p>

<h2 class="cont_tit">Operation GhostSecret Overview</h2>
<p class="cont_txt">
GhostSecret was a cyberwarfare espionage operation conducted by the North Korean-sponsored group Hidden Cobra in 2018. This campaign targeted the defense, finance, healthcare, and telecommunications sectors across several countries, including South Korea, the United States, and Japan. Hidden Cobra modified an advanced malware implant, Destroyer, to create a new variant named Escad, specifically designed for undetected intelligence gathering and data exfiltration.
</p>

<h2 class="cont_tit">Offensive Cyber Strategy</h2>

<h3>Phishing Campaigns - Logical Tool for Initial Access</h3>
<p class="cont_txt">
Discretion is essential in espionage. Phishing techniques, including familiarity, authority, and consensus, help gain access without detection. Hidden Cobra used tailored spear phishing attacks, such as during Operation Dream Job (2019), to exploit target vulnerabilities, showcasing how comprehensive phishing strategies are vital for GhostSecret.
</p>

<h3>Rogue Access Point - Physical Tool for Persistence and Data Collection</h3>
<p class="cont_txt">
Although not used directly in GhostSecret, a Rogue Access Point could enable persistent data collection. Deployed after initial access, it could intercept network traffic, capture data, and distribute malware like Escad. This tool would enhance persistence and data exfiltration in a campaign like GhostSecret.
</p>

<h3>Escad Malware - Logical Tool for Data Collection and Exfiltration</h3>
<p class="cont_txt">
Escad is a variant of the Destroyer Malware, repurposed as a backdoor for espionage rather than disruption. Hidden Cobra used Escad to maintain persistence, gather intelligence, and conduct reconnaissance, making it particularly effective for GhostSecret’s objectives.
</p>

<h2 class="cont_tit">Legal Issues Governing the Authorized Conduct of South Korean Offensive Cyber Operations</h2>
<p class="cont_txt">
South Korea’s cyber doctrine includes multiple laws relevant to operations like GhostSecret. These laws include:
</p>
<ul class="cont_txt">
<li><strong>Personal Information Protection Act (PIPA):</strong> Governs data protection for South Korean citizens’ personal information, enacted in 2011.</li>
<li><strong>Critical Information Infrastructure Protection Act (CIIPA):</strong> Enacted in 2005, CIIPA outlines protections for public safety and national security data.</li>
<li><strong>Information and Communications Network Act (ICNA):</strong> Enacted in 2001, ICNA provides guidelines for protecting service provider data and network security.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="cont_tit">Summary of Related Tools, Techniques, Technology, and Data</h2>
<p class="cont_txt">
For Operation GhostSecret’s offensive strategy, three primary tools are recommended:
</p>
<ul class="cont_txt">
<li><strong>Phishing Campaigns:</strong> Used for initial access via social engineering.</li>
<li><strong>Rogue Access Points:</strong> Provide network persistence and data capture opportunities.</li>
<li><strong>Escad Malware:</strong> Facilitates intelligence gathering and discrete data exfiltration.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="cont_tit">Defensive Cyber Strategy</h2>

<h3>Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW) - Physical Architecture for Network Security</h3>
<p class="cont_txt">
NGFWs offer intrusion detection/prevention, crucial in detecting Rogue Access Points or malware traffic. They serve as a preventive layer in cyber espionage defense by identifying known indicators of compromise.
</p>

<h3>Security Information and Event Management Platform (SIEM) - Logical Tool for Security Operations</h3>
<p class="cont_txt">
SIEM platforms, like Splunk or Microsoft Sentinel, provide centralized data aggregation and log analysis. These platforms help analysts triage, escalate, and mitigate security incidents efficiently within the enterprise environment.
</p>

<h3>Extended Detection and Response Platform (XDR) - Logical Tool for Endpoint Security</h3>
<p class="cont_txt">
XDR solutions, such as Defender XDR or TrendMicro, offer endpoint security across cloud, network, and data endpoints. They allow for fast response and implementation of IAM best practices, improving confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
</p>

<h2 class="cont_tit">Legal Issues Governing the Authorized Conduct of South Korean Defensive Cyber Operations</h2>
<p class="cont_txt">
South Korean defensive cyber operations are governed by the following regulations:
</p>
<ul class="cont_txt">
<li><strong>Information and Communications Network Act (ICNA):</strong> Failure to secure essential digital assets may result in fines and imprisonment.</li>
<li><strong>Critical Information Infrastructure Protection Act (CIIPA):</strong> Mandates protection of vital digital assets crucial to national security.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="cont_tit">Summary of Defensive Tools, Techniques, Technology, and Data</h2>
<p class="cont_txt">
Recommended defensive tools include:
</p>
<ul class="cont_txt">
<li><strong>Next-Generation Firewall:</strong> Enhances network security with intrusion detection and prevention.</li>
<li><strong>SIEM Platform:</strong> Aggregates data for efficient threat management and response.</li>
<li><strong>XDR Solution:</strong> Provides comprehensive endpoint visibility and rapid response capabilities.</li>
</ul>
