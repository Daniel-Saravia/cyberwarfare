  <h2 class="cont_tit">Description</h2>
  <p class="cont_txt">
    A challenge that drastically affects South Korea's ability to conduct cyberwarfare planning and deployment at a nation-state level is the legal and ethical considerations and risks of cyberwarfare operations. As a NATO-friendly country, the Republic of Korea must adhere to the ethical standards and guidelines that other NATO allied and partnered countries follow. Additionally, the Republic of Korea has outlined strategic tasks including the establishment of governance based on cooperation and trust with public, private, and international parties.
  </p>
  <p class="cont_txt">
    This challenge can also be considered a psychological weapon through the application of digital information and perception warfare. Cyberwarfare operations, when implemented, can manipulate the public perception of information causing misinformation, anarchy, and general disruption of the public's well-being. The psychological effect of cyberwarfare operations and the potent threat of misinformation must be taken into consideration throughout the planning and deployment stages.
  </p>
  <p class="cont_txt">
    Due to a lack of clear guidelines, cyberwarfare exists in a grey area of international laws and regulations. Both defensive and offensive planning can be hindered by ethical boundaries and legal jurisdictions, especially with emerging technologies like artificial intelligence. A failure to account for these considerations can result in backlash and consequences from both international and state parties. Foreign adversaries, such as North Korean state-sponsored APT groups, could exploit these failures to conduct espionage and attacks on South Korea's critical infrastructure.

  <h3>Before Action</h3>
  <ul class="cont_txt">
    <li>
      Evaluate the scope and impact of activities based on state and international legal and ethical considerations. Adhere to South Korea's cyberwarfare strategy and NATO's cyberwarfare guidelines.
    </li>
    <li>
      Assess legal and ethical boundaries during the planning stage to identify potential violations. This evaluation should involve key members of South Korea's cyberwarfare strategy committee and require majority approval for implementation.
    </li>
    <li>
      Communicate with NATO parties, if appropriate, to set expectations and prevent misinterpretation of actions.
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>During Action</h3>
  <ul class="cont_txt">
    <li>
      Continuously monitor and assess cyberwarfare activities to ensure adherence to legal and ethical guidelines established in the planning phase.
    </li>
    <li>
      Identify a clear scope and purpose for the activity to ensure evaluations remain relevant.
    </li>
    <li>
      In the event of potential violations, adjust the activity or stop it altogether. Response teams should be in place to prevent unintended escalations.
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>After Action</h3>
  <ul class="cont_txt">
    <li>
      Use extensive documentation from the planning and implementation phases to evaluate the effectiveness of controls and the impact of the activity.
    </li>
    <li>
      Collect feedback and communicate with other parties, including NATO allies, for diplomatic purposes and transparency.
    </li>
    <li>
      If the scope of an activity was breached, consider the consequences and be transparent with allies to avoid misinterpretation of actions.
    </li>
  </ul>
