  <!-- Description -->
  <h2 class="cont_tit">Description</h2>
  <p class="cont_txt">
    One defensive cyber challenge for the Republic of Korea lies in safeguarding its supply chain against cyber threats. A supply chain refers to the network of entities, processes, and technologies involved in the production, distribution, and delivery of goods and services. This includes manufacturers, suppliers, logistics providers, software developers, and hardware vendors. As supply chains become more digital and interconnected, they often present more entry points for cyber threats to exploit vulnerabilities.
  </p>
  <p class="cont_txt">
    Cyber threats to supply chains often target software updates, embedded hardware components, and third-party vendors, leveraging weaknesses to infiltrate critical systems. For the Republic of Korea, a nation heavily reliant on advanced digital infrastructure and global trade, these risks are significantly amplified. Its geopolitical proximity to cyber-capable adversaries like North Korea and China further increases its vulnerability. These attacks can compromise national defense systems, disrupt essential services, and leak sensitive intellectual property, impacting economic stability and security. Left unaddressed, these vulnerabilities could destabilize critical operations and threaten South Korea's global standing.

  <h2 class="cont_tit">Plan</h2>
  
  <h3>Before Action</h3>
  <ul class="cont_txt">
    <li>Conduct a thorough evaluation of the digital supply chain to identify vulnerabilities, including audits of vendors, suppliers, and partners.</li>
    <li>Establish stringent security requirements for third-party providers and implement secure procurement processes.</li>
    <li>Develop a policy framework aligned with global cybersecurity standards and foster international collaboration to strengthen defenses.</li>
    <li>Perform regular vulnerability testing and provide training for stakeholders to enhance readiness.</li>
    <li>Establish secure communication channels for information sharing during incidents.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>During Action</h3>
  <ul class="cont_txt">
    <li>Immediately contain and neutralize the threat by isolating compromised systems and investigating the breach's origin and scope.</li>
    <li>Utilize real-time monitoring and advanced threat detection tools for effective threat management.</li>
    <li>Coordinate mitigation efforts among national agencies, private sector stakeholders, and international partners.</li>
    <li>Maintain clear and transparent communication with affected entities to sustain trust during mitigation processes.</li>
    <li>Provide continuous training and rehearsals for cyber incident response to minimize disruptions.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>After Action</h3>
  <ul class="cont_txt">
    <li>Conduct a detailed evaluation to assess the response's effectiveness and identify improvement areas.</li>
    <li>Analyze the infiltration methods, evaluate detection and response measures, and update security protocols to address identified gaps.</li>
    <li>Foster ongoing collaboration with supply chain partners and international allies to enhance resilience and prevent future incidents.</li>
    <li>Conduct regular scenario planning exercises and share lessons learned with stakeholders to reinforce cybersecurity strategies.</li>
    <li>Continuously improve based on evaluations to ensure the digital supply chain remains secure against evolving threats.</li>
  </ul>
